## Outcome

A pixel art version of your crew mascot.

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={["fas", "alien-monster"]} size="3x" color="#4285f4" />

This exercise requires a <Link to="../mascot-animals">mascot animal</Link>.

## Setup

Prepare a collage of images for your crew mascot from the web.

This should only take 5 minutes.

## Process

All together!

Decide on a design that everyone likes.

Now create a pixel art version of your crew mascot.

You can do that physically with post-it notes or digitally in figma, Mural, google slides etc.
Limit yourself to a 20x20 pixel grid, i.e. 20x20 post-its or squares.

### Bonus

Make it public.
Share you pixel mascot with your colleagues either online or physically.

**If you're using post-its:**
Lift the post-its from the side instead of pulling it vertically from the bottom.
This keeps the post-its flat and prevents the typical curve.
