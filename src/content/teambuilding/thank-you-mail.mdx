## Setup

Each crewmember writes a postcard to each other member of the crew.

Decide on a date on which all the postcards should be sen (e.g. Dec 16th).

## Process

Everyone by themselves on their schedule (maybe offline).

Write each postcard as a thankyou-letter to your fellow crewmember.
Tell that person what you like and value about them.
Each postcard should send the message: "Thank you for being part of this crew!"

Take at least 5 minutes per postcard. But don't overthink it. Just write from your heart.

### Bonus

Postcards have two sides. One should hold your message.
You could buy beautiful postcards or get some blank ones and create artworks of your own.
