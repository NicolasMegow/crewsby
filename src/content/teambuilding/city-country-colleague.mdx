## Outcome

Collect the most points by having the most original answers.

Just like the game “city, country, river”.

## Setup

Each crew member should draw a table. The rows contain the names of the crew members, the columns contain categories.

### Example

| Colleague   | Eye color | Birthday | Hobby | Favorite food | Mascot | Next holiday | Tick | Wish |
| :---------- | :-------- | :------- | :---- | :------------ | :----- | :----------- | :--- | :--- |
| Max Mueller | ?         | ?        | ?     | ?             | ?      | ?            | ?    | ?    |
| ...         | ?         | ?        | ?     | ?             | ?      | ?            | ?    | ?    |

The table is transposed compared to traditional "city, country, river" for better performance on A4 in landscape.

## Process

Everyone against everyone!

Fill in the columns for all crew members (including yourselves) as quick as possible.

Whoever finishes first, shouts "Stop". Immediately everyone has to drop the pens and is not allowed to enter an answer anymore.

And go!

## Finish

Read out all answers of a category (column) in turn for the allocation of points per crew member (row).
The particular crew member is the last to read his own answer and does not receive any points for it.

5 points for the correct answer, if only one crew member has it.
3 points for the correct answer, if several have it.
1 point for an alternative answer that is generally accepted.
