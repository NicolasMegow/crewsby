## Intro

People are awesome.

Unfortunately, we easily forget this fact in our daily grind.
Radical Candor combines two ideas: to care personally and to challenge directly.
To balance both enables you to establish productive relationships.

## Radical Candor inspires teamspirit <Emoji symbol="❤️" label="heart"/>

Teamspirit is a matter of reciprocity
Once you start to care personally and challenge directly, you initiate a positive spiral.

## Radical Candor is useful, if ...

- you are surrounded by awesome colleagues,
- or you believe them to be idiots
- and there is a possibility you're wrong.
