## Intro

"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"
Parkinson's law

Kanban helps us to design this time.
Kanban visualizes the process of value creation.

## Kanban liberates processes <Emoji symbol="ðŸ’ª" label="muscle"/>

Traditionally, work is pushed through processes.
Kanban pulls work and limits the work in progress

With these changes, Kanban facilitates the identification and elimination of productivity drains.
It establishes a flow and rhythm of work while increasing quality and quantity of output.

## Kanban is useful, if...

- you are working on reasonably similar work pakets,
- value creation consists of multiple steps,
- you seek to scale processes.
