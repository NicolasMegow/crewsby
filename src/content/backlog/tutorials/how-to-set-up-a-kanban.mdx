## Intro

"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"
Parkinson's law

Kanban helps us to design this time.
Kanban visualizes the process of value creation.

## Kanban liberates processes <Emoji symbol="ðŸ’ª" label="muscle"/>

Traditionally, work is pushed through processes.
Kanban pulls work and limits the work in progress

With these changes, Kanban facilitates the identification and elimination of productivity drains.
It establishes a flow and rhythm of work while increasing quality and quantity of output.

## Kanban is useful, if...

- you are working on reasonably similar work pakets,
- value creation consists of multiple steps,
- you seek to scale processes.

## Outcome

Set up a Kanban board.

Includes an understanding of the way rituals create culture.

## Structure

Set a date & time.

Prepare a discord channel or send us a note to meet at ours at [bakery@crewsby.com](mailto:bakery@crewsby.com).
Voice only channels, like discord, allow for more informal conversation in a kitchen.

Decide who'll bake what kind of cookie.

### Bonus

Create your crew playlist for the holidays or asign a DJ.

**And go!**

## Process

All together!

Get together virtually via smartphone or tablet, everyone in their kitchens with the ingredients ready.

Start the music and get to it.

## Reflection

**Take a moment before sharing your experience:**

1. What did you find interesting?
2. What did you not expect?
3. Whose cookies are you looking most forward to?
4. What do you take away from this exercise?
