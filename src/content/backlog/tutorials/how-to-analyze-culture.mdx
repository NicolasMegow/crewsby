Includes an understanding of the way rituals create culture.

## Structure

Set a date & time.

Prepare a discord channel or send us a note to meet at ours at [bakery@crewsby.com](mailto:bakery@crewsby.com).
Voice only channels, like discord, allow for more informal conversation in a kitchen.

Decide who'll bake what kind of cookie.

### Bonus

Create your crew playlist for the holidays or asign a DJ.

**And go!**

## Process

All together!

Get together virtually via smartphone or tablet, everyone in their kitchens with the ingredients ready.

Start the music and get to it.
