## Outcome

Experience the support of your team with regard to your weaknesses.

## Structure

Take 10 minutes to write down all the weaknesses you see in the other team members.

Then collect all the weaknesses in a list without the corresponding names – on post-its, on a whiteboard, or in a google doc.

### Examples

- Communicates with bias
- Commits but doesn't deliver
- Output lacks attention to detail

## Process

All for one!

One after the other picks three weaknesses from the list that he or she perceives to be most pronounced in themselves.

The other team members are then allowed to react. Either with a friendly

“Bingo – here’s a tip on how to deal with it better…”

Or with an astonished

“Well, I don’t see it that way…”

### Bonus

Really good tips include establishing contact with persons who have had similar challenges or things you have already tried yourself.

Of course, the weaknesses no one has seen in themselves are interesting. Keep them for the next training session.

**And go!**
