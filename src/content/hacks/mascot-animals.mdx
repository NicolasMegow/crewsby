### <Emoji symbol="🦄" label="unicorn" /> <Emoji symbol="🦏" label="rhino" /> <Emoji symbol="🐞" label="beetle" /> <Emoji symbol="🦦" label="otter" /> <Emoji symbol="🦚" label="peacock" />

Please take 5 minutes to come up with multiple ideas.

Then select your personal favorite as team mascot.
Draw a quick sketch of the animal you've each chosen.

## Process

All together!

Share your mascots with the team.
