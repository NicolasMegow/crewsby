## Outcome

Plan two contact points with each other.

## Structure

Each crew member draws the network of the crew.

Write yourself in the middle of a circle. You distribute your crew members on the edge of the circle. Now connect with your crew members through lines.

### Example

Each crew member should now have a (more or less pretty) star in front of him.

- Nicolas ---> Sebastian
- Nicolas ---> Tim
- Nicolas ---> Lars

Now write down topics on each line that you want to talk about. Take about 5 minutes of your time.

## Process

2-3 rounds in pairs

Distribute yourselves in pairs and exchange to the topics. Discuss briefly (again about 5 minutes) what possibilities you have to enjoy these commonalities.

### Bonus

The topics do not always fit right away. That is completely normal.
Try to find something you are enthusiastic about.

After 5 minutes you change partners and repeat it with your new partner.

**And go!**

## Reflection

**Take a moment before sharing your experience:**

1. What did you find interesting?
2. What did you not expect?
3. Which new similarities did you discover?
4. What do you take away from this exercise?
