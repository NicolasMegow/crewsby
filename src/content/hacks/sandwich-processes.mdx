## Outcome

Structure the process by making sandwiches.

## Structure

Each crew member makes a sketch of how he or she prepares a sandwich.
The design of this sketch is up to each crew member.
Do not forget to draw the sandwich.
Take 5 minutes of your time.

**And go!**

## Process

All together!

Now compare the sketches.

Discuss similarities and differences.

Then agree on some features that characterize the best sandwich.

### Bonus

Subdivide the process of making a sandwich in essential steps.

For each of these steps, define characteristics of an intermediate product.
