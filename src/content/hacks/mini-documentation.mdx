## Outcome

Create clear sketches.

## Structure

Each crew member thinks about an improvement for the team and makes a sketch of it.

This sketch may not contain any words, only pictures.

Take 5 minutes of your time.

## Process

All together, one after the other!

One by one, each crew member shows his/her sketch without comment.

The rest of the crew now has to guess as quickly as possible what kind of improvement is shown. Stop the time. The sketch that was guessed the fastest wins.

**And go!**

Start a second round.

This time you may add some annotations to your sketches.

## Reflection

**Take a moment before sharing your experience:**
