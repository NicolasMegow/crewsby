## Setup

There can be many questions behind an agenda item that need to be clarified.

Write down - each for himself/herself - all questions that come to your mind regarding the following agenda items:

- Review Q1
- Next steps

**Take 10 minutes of your time.**

### Bonus

Especially write down trivial questions.

Be concerned with quantity, not quality.

**And go!**

## Process

All together!

Now collect all questions - on the whiteboard or in a google doc.

Delete questions that occur twice or differ only marginally.

Finally, create a new agenda from the four most important questions.

## Reflection

**Take a moment before sharing your experience:**

1. What did you find interesting?
2. What did you not expect?
3. Which new similarities did you discover?
4. What do you take away from this exercise?
