## Setup

Form pairs.

If you are an odd number of team members, one is the timekeeper.

Now each of you thinks about a micro skill he or she wants to learn from their partner.

### Example

This micro skill should be job-related and formulated in the form "subject + verb".

- understand git-branching,
- select color combinations,
- or formulate a friendly rejection.

Please take 5 minutes of your time. It is more important that you learn something than what exactly you learn.

## Process

2 rounds of 7 minutes each.

Your partner now has 7 minutes to teach you this micro skill. You can use all available means and media. And of course you are welcome to ask for more information.

After the initial 7 minutes you switch and teach your partner their desired micro skill.

### Bonus:

Do not worry if your expert enough for this.

Trust your intuition and explain the first thing that comes into your mind.

**And go!**

## Reflection

** Take a moment before sharing your experience: **

2. What would you like to learn next from a team member?
3. How did it feel to pass on knowledge?
4. What do you take with you from this exercise?
